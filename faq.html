				<h5>Does Iris replace 911?</h5>
				<p>NO. Iris is not and should never be a replacement for emergency service professionals. Iris’s purpose is to inform your loved ones in the event that you are at the hospital and unable to inform them yourself. In additon, Iris will provide medical professionals at the ER with a digital health card via your lock screen with all of your necessary health info while they wait for your loved one to contact them or arrive. In the event of an emergency, you should always call 911.</p>

				<h5>What happens if I’m visiting someone at a hospital and Iris detects me there?</h5>
				<p>NO. Iris is not and should never be a replacement for emergency service professionals. Iris’s purpose is to inform your loved ones in the event that you are at the hospital and unable to inform them yourself. In additon, Iris will provide medical professionals at the ER with a digital health card via your lock screen with all of your necessary health info while they wait for your loved one to contact them or arrive. In the event of an emergency, you should always call 911.</p>

			<div class="single-faq">
				<h5>Will it ever send false-positive alerts to my contacts?</h5>
				<p>We worked very hard as a team and even re-wrote our entire code to ensure the stability of the platform for you. Does this mean technology will never fail? No. We never want to lead you to believe hiccups will not occur but our server (where all of the data is stored and our notification system runs off of) is on Amazon Web Services which very rarely is negatively impacting companies.</p>
				<p>Outside of our control, something else that can cause a false positive is being in a major city. Iris has what are called geofences set up around every hospital so we tell our system it is a hospital and in turn can easily notice when you’re at one. Sometimes in large cities your cell phone, or rather your cell phone service, can’t properly provide accurate location, so it thinks you’re across the street at Starbucks rather than the Hospital.</p>
				<p>We’re using very advanced location and geofence technology and we don’t anticipate these false-positives will occur often at all. However, a few must in order for us to make the platform smarter and learn from that. in the event that it happens to you, please reach out to us at support@getiris.co</p>
			</div>
			<div class="single-faq">
				<h5>Can my emergency contacts add me as their EC?</h5>
				<p>Yes, in fact, they should. We’ve found the chances of someone adding you back if you added them are more likely than not.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="single-faq">
				<h5>What location data does Iris track?</h5>
				<p>Yes, in fact, they should. We’ve found the chances of someone adding you back if you added them are more likely than not.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="single-faq">
				<h5>What information of a user is stored on the Iris server?</h5>
				<p>Yes, in fact, they should. We’ve found the chances of someone adding you back if you added them are more likely than not.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="single-faq">
				<h5>Does Iris have HIPAA compliancy?</h5>
				<p>Yes, in fact, they should. We’ve found the chances of someone adding you back if you added them are more likely than not.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="single-faq">
				<h5>How does Iris know I’m at the hospital?</h5>
				<p>Yes, in fact, they should. We’ve found the chances of someone adding you back if you added them are more likely than not.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="single-faq">
				<h5>Does Iris work if I have no cell service?</h5>
				<p>Unfortunately, no. That’s something we’re looking heavily into as we speak, but as of right now, Iris cannot function without any form of data or cell service which is necessary to detect you at the hospital, communicate with you and know to inform your loved one. However, if your cell service kicks back in at any point in the hospital, Iris will still detect you there.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="single-faq">
				<h5>Don’t a lot of hospitals have bad service?</h5>
				<p>Yes, the service is typically not the best in hospitals, but the strength all depends on your cell phone provider. We’ve found after visiting a number of hospitals around the world, that the waiting room is where the service is the weakest and the ER itself resumes as ‘normal’. As in, normally not the best but certainly not poor. In the event of a critical moment where Iris is necessary, you’ll more than likely be taken right to the ER and quite quickly at that, where your cell phone and Iris will get the job done.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="single-faq">
				<h5>Does Iris work if my phone breaks in an emergency situation?</h5>
				<p>Hmm, maybe. Define break? A phone can have shattered glass and be chipped in some areas and still function. So long as the phone can connect to your data, Iris will get the job done. If the emergency situation caused your phone to break, odds are likely you need your loved ones, so once Iris is able to detect you at the hospital, your emergency contacts will be informed—even if you didn’t reply to Iris’s push notification asking if you’re okay. At the end of the day, that’s the purpose of Iris—to inform your loved ones in the critical moment when you’re unable to yourself.</p> 
				<p>In the same token though, it’s important to note that if your screen is shattered or broken in any way, Iris will still surface your digital health card on the lockscree, but the chances are low that a medical professional will be able to swipe to view it. So long as the screen is visible though and the phone at its core is fully functioning, Iris will work. But it should be understood that it may not work as accurately as usual. You never know what actually is broken inside the phone.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="single-faq">
				<h5>Can medical professionals and others access my phone through the lock screen from my digital health card?</h5>
				<p>Never. Your digital health card lives in the Wallet app. The two sole reasons we did this was to (1) Ensure quick and easy access to your card, as it is surfaced on your lock screen as soon as we confirmed you are at the hospital in a critical moment. (2) Security with cards in Wallet can only be accessed via the lockscreen and ensure content can be viewed without needing to access the phone itself.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="single-faq">
				<h5>How much does Iris cost?</h5>
				<p>Iris is free. Though we are exploring different opportunities for paid plans and monetization in general, the hospital detection and what you currently have access to will always be free.</p>
			</div>
			<div class="single-faq">
				<h5>Will Iris spam me with text messages?</h5>
				<p>Never. The only time Iris will reach out [to anyone] via SMS is if you are an emergency contact and are being informed that your loved one is in a critical moment or to inform you that you were added as an Emergency Contact by someone.</p>
