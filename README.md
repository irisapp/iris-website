# Iris
Your modern day emergency alert

## How does it work?
Iris notifies your loved ones during the critical moments when you can’t. Be it close to home or overseas, Iris takes notice if you’re at a hospital and incapable of reaching out to loved ones. When you can't, they're provided the info they need via text message, email or push-notification, so they can be by your side.
